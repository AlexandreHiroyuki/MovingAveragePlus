## Description

> _Old name: MovingAverage_ArduinoLibrary_

**This library is deprecated. All support is now dedicated to [Data Tome](https://github.com/AlexandreHiroyuki/DataTome)!**

**[Data Tome](https://github.com/AlexandreHiroyuki/DataTome) includes all the features of Moving Average Plus, in addition to many other features, such as better type control, more statistics, and better test coverage.**

**Start coding with [Data Tome](https://github.com/AlexandreHiroyuki/DataTome)!**

> This library is listed in the official [Arduino Library Manager](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/movingaverageplus/), and you can also find it at [Arduino Library List](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/moving-average-plus).
>
> _—Recommended Platform—_ Now it's possible to install this library on the [PlatformIO Registry](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/alexandrehiroyuki/MovingAveragePlus)!
>
> Check our **exclusive** feature, the Partials!
