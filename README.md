> _Old name: MovingAverage_ArduinoLibrary_

A C++ library that implements a moving average on the Arduino platform. Performance and usability are the two focuses I thought of when creating this library, so every improving tip is welcome.

This library is listed in the official [Arduino Library Manager](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/movingaverageplus/), and you can also find it at [Arduino Library List](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/moving-average-plus).

_**—Recommended Platform—**_ Now it's possible to install this library on the [PlatformIO Registry](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/alexandrehiroyuki/MovingAveragePlus)!

Check our **exclusive** feature, the Partials!

## Documentation

This library implements the moving average using a circular array to improve the performance.
